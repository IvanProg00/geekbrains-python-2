# Task 1

Write a program that accepts a string as input and keeps track of how many times
each character has already been encountered. The number of repetitions is added to
the characters using the `_n` format postfix.

## Example

- `a a a b c a a d c d d` -> `a a_1 a_2 b c a_3 a_4 d c_1 d_1 d_2`
