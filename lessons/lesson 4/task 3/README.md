# Task 3

Vanya and Petya argued who would solve the following problem faster: “A sequence
of non-negative integers is given. It is required to determine the value of the
largest element of the sequence that ends with the first encountered zero (the number
0 is not included in the sequence)”. However, 2 friends were not so smart. None of
the guys were able to complete this task. They decided this way: whoever has fewer
errors in the code wins the argument. The comrades turned to you, the students, for
help.
