# Task 4

Two distinct natural numbers n and m are called friendly if the sum of the divisors
of the number n (including 1, but excluding n itself) is equal to the number m and
vice versa. For example, 220 and 284 are friendly numbers. For a given number k,
output all pairs of friendly numbers, each of which does not exceed k. The program
receives one natural number k, not exceeding 10^5, as input. The program should output
all pairs of friendly numbers, each of which does not exceed k. Pairs must be output
one per line, separated by spaces. Each pair should be output only once (permutation
of numbers does not give a new pair).

## Example

- 1220 -> `(220, 284), (1184, 1210)`
