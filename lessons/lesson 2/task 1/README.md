# Task 1

Tired of an unusually warm winter, residents decided to find out if this is really
the longest thaw in the history of weather observations. They turned to weather
forecasters, and they, in turn, engaged in research statistics for the past years.
They are interested in how many days the longest thaw lasted. They call a thaw a
period in which the average daily temperature exceeded 0 degrees Celsius daily.
Write a program that helps weather forecasters in their work.

The user enters the number N – the total number of days under consideration
(1 ≤ N ≤ 100). In the following lines there are N integers. Each number is the average
daily temperature on the corresponding day. Temperatures are integers and range
from -50 to 50

## Example

- count: 6; temperatures -20 30 -40 50 10 -10 -> 2
