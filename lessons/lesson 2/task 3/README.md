# Task 3

Ivan Vasilyevich came to the market and decided to buy two watermelons: one for himself
and the other for his mother-in-law. It is clear that you need to choose a heavier
watermelon for yourself, and a lighter one for your mother-in-law. But here's the
problem: there are too many watermelons, and he does not know how to choose the lightest
and heaviest watermelon? Help him!

The user enters one number N â€“ the number of watermelons. The second line contains
N numbers written on a new line each. Here, each number is the mass of the corresponding
watermelon. All numbers are natural and do not exceed 30,000.

## Example

- 3 -> 6 (`1 * 2 * 3`)
- 5 -> 120 (`1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5`)
