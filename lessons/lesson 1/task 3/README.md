# Task 3

The cars in the train are numbered with natural numbers, starting from 1 (sometimes
the cars are numbered from the "head" of the train, and sometimes from the "tail";
it depends on which way the train goes). Each car has its number written on it.
Vitya got into the i-th car from the head of the train and found that his car has
the number j. He wants to determine how many cars there are in the train. Write
a program that will do this or report that it is impossible to do this without additional
information.

## Example

- i=3; j=4 -> 6
