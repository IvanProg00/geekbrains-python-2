# Task 2

At some school, they decided to recruit three new math classes and equip the classrooms
for them with new desks. Two students can sit at each desk. The number of students
in each of the three classes is known. Print the smallest number of desks that you
need to purchase for them.

## Example

- first=21; second=21; third=21 -> 32
