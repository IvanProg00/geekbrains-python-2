# Task 3

In the board game Scrabble, each letter has a certain value. In the case of the
English alphabet, points are distributed as follows: A, E, I, O, U, L, N, S, T,
R – 1 point; D, G – 2 points; B, C, M, P – 3 points; F, H, V, W, Y – 4 points; K
– 5 points; J, X – 8 points; Q, Z – 10 points. And Russian letters are evaluated
as follows: А, В, Е, И, Н, О, Р, С, Т – 1 point; Д, К, Л, М, П, У – 2 points; Б,
Г, Ё, Ь, Я – 3 points; Й, Ы – 4 points; Ж, З, Х, Ц, Ч – 5 points; Ш, Э, Ю – 8 points;
Ф, Щ, Ъ – 10 points. Write a program that calculates the cost of the word entered
by the user. We will assume that only one word is submitted to the input, which
contains either only English or only Russian letters.
