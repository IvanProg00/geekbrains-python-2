# Task 3

Do you use public transport? You probably paid for the fare and received a ticket
with a number. A lucky ticket is a ticket with a sixâ€“digit number, where the sum
of the first three digits is equal to the sum of the last three. I.e., a ticket
with the number 385916 is a lucky one, because 3+8+5=9+1+6. You need to write a
program that checks the ticket's happiness.

## Example

- 385916 -> yes
- 123456 -> no
