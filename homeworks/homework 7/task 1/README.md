# Task 1

Winnie the Pooh asked you to see if there is a rhythm in his poems. Since it is not
so easy to understand his chants, how easily he comes up with them, you should write
a program. Winnie-the-Pooh believes that there is a rhythm if the number of syllables
(i.e. the number of vowel letters) in each phrase of the poem is the same. A phrase
can consist of one word, if there are several words in the phrase, then they are
separated by hyphens. Phrases are separated from each other by spaces. The poem Winnie-the-Pooh
drives into the program from the keyboard. In the answer, write “Pam pam pam” if
the rhythm is all right and “Pam param”, if the rhythm is not all right.

## Example

- `пара-ра-рам рам-пам-папам па-ра-па-да` -> `Парам пам-пам`
