Two unordered sets of integers are given (maybe with repetitions). Output without
repetition in ascending order all the numbers that occur in both sets.

The user enters 2 numbers. n is the number of elements of the first set. m is the
number of elements of the second set. Then the user enters the elements of the sets
themselves.
