# Task 2

Blueberries are grown on a farm in Karelia. It grows on a round bed, and the bushes
are planted only around the circumference. Thus, each bush has exactly two neighboring
ones. In total, there are N bushes growing on the bed.

These bushes have different yields, so by the time they were harvested, a different
number of berries had grown on them â€” ai berries had grown on the i-th bush.

This farm has implemented an automatic blueberry harvesting system. This system consists
of a control module and several collecting modules. The collecting module in one
go, being directly in front of some bush, collects berries from this bush and from
two neighboring ones.

Write a program to find the maximum number of berries that the collecting module
can collect in one go, being in front of some bush of the garden specified in the
input file.
